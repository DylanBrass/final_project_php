## Project Description 

### Application's purpose
The application is a dynamic chat room where users gain access by signing in with valid credentials (username and password). Once successfully authenticated, users can unlock the full chat room experience. This includes access to a list of registered users, enabling them to initiate conversations with fellow users. This is the back-end documentation of the application.
